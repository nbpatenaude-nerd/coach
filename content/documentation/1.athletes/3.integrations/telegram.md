The Journey Endurance Coaching Platform Telegram integration allows you to chat with your coach directly from your favorite messaging app. It's perfect for quick questions about your training, nutrition, or checking your recovery status on the go.

## 1. Setup Guide

To link your Journey Endurance Coaching Platform account to Telegram:

1. Log in to your **Dashboard**.
2. Navigate to **Settings → Apps**.
3. Locate the **Telegram** section and click **Link Account**.
4. A unique, temporary link or token will be generated.
5. Click the link to open Telegram, or send the `/start [your-token]` command directly to the **@CoachWattsBot**.

Success: Once linked, the bot will welcome you, and you can start chatting immediately.

## 2. Available Commands

The bot supports several commands to help you manage your interaction:

- `/help`: Displays a list of available commands and a brief overview of what the coach can do.
- `/start`: Used initially to link your account or to restart the conversation if you've disconnected.
- `/roominfo`: Shows the current Chat Room ID. Journey Endurance Coaching Platform organizes conversations into "Rooms" (sessions) to maintain context.

## 3. How it Works

### Chat Sessions

To keep your conversations focused and efficient, Journey Endurance Coaching Platform uses **Session Rooms**.

- If you haven't chatted for more than **6 hours**, a new room will be automatically created.
- This ensures the AI isn't overwhelmed by weeks of old context while still remembering recent instructions.

### What to Ask

You can ask anything you would normally ask in the main Journey Endurance Coaching Platform Chat:

- "How did my workout look today?"
- "What should I eat before my long run tomorrow?"
- "I'm feeling a bit tired, should I adjust my intensity?"

## 4. Troubleshooting

- **Expired Token**: If your `/start` token expires, generate a new one from **Settings → Apps**.
- **Not Responding**: If the bot doesn't respond, try sending `/help` to verify the connection, or check your integration status under **Settings → Apps**.
- **Disconnecting**: To stop receiving messages on Telegram, revoke the integration from **Settings → Apps** or block the bot in Telegram.
