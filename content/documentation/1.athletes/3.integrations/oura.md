## Troubleshooting

### Readiness not showing

- Oura readiness publishes after your sleep is scored — usually within an hour of waking
- Open the Oura app to confirm the data exists, then **Sync** in Journey Endurance Coaching Platform

### Connecting multiple wellness devices

If you also connect Garmin or WHOOP, Journey Endurance Coaching Platform prioritizes the most recent data. For consistent trends, one primary wellness source is recommended.
