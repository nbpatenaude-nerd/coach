# Email Communication System

The Journey Endurance Coaching Platform Email Communication System is a centralized, compliant, and branded platform for lifecycle, product, and transactional notifications. It leverages Nuxt 3, Trigger.dev v3, and Resend for efficient and reliable delivery.

## Key Features

- **Branded Templates**: Custom Vue-based templates using `@vue-email/nuxt`, following the official style guide (Public Sans, Action Green).
- **Automated Dispatch (Default)**: Outbound emails are automatically dispatched via Resend after being rendered and recorded in the database.
- **Optional Approval Gate**: Manual review can be re-enabled globally by setting `DISABLE_EMAILS=true` in the environment. In this mode, emails are held in `QUEUED` status for manual approval in the `/admin/emails` dashboard.
- **User Preference Center**: Granular opt-in/opt-out controls in user settings (Training Insights, Product, Marketing, etc.).
- **Automated Triggers**: Seamless integration with system events like signup, subscription updates, and AI workout analysis.
- **Automatic Training Recommendations**: Daily coaching briefs sent based on user-configurable schedules and automated sync events.
- **Secure Unsubscribe**: One-click, unauthenticated unsubscribe flow using cryptographic HMAC-signed tokens.

## Architecture

1.  **Triggering**: A domain event or manual CLI command triggers the `send-email` task in Trigger.dev.
2.  **Orchestration**: The `send-email` task:
    - Verifies user preferences and suppression status.
    - Generates a secure cryptographic unsubscribe token.
    - Calls an internal Nuxt API (`/api/internal/render-email`) to render the Vue template to HTML.
    - **UTM Injection**: Automatically constructs a standard `utmQuery` string based on the registry's `utmCampaign` and `utmMedium` metadata and injects it into the template's props.
3.  **Queuing**: The delivery record is saved to the `EmailDelivery` table with a `QUEUED` status.
4.  **Dispatch**: Unless `DISABLE_EMAILS=true` is set, the system automatically transitions the status to `SENDING` and dispatches the email via Resend API.
5.  **Admin Review (Optional)**: If automatic dispatch is disabled, admins preview the rendered HTML and metadata in the dashboard and click "Send Now" to manually trigger sending.
6.  **Webhook Ingestion**: Resend webhooks notify the system of delivery, open, and click events, which are processed by the `ResendService` in the background worker.

## Campaigns & Automated Flows

### 1. Onboarding (Transactional)

- **Welcome**: Sent immediately upon signup as a required TRANSACTIONAL account creation notice (`preferenceKey: null`).
- **Onboarding Drip Sequence**: Managed via `schedule-onboarding-drip` Trigger.dev task:
  - **Day 2 Integration Check**: Evaluates user integration state; sent only if no training platforms are connected.
  - **Day 7 First Week Review**: Check-in on trial progress and fitness dashboard trends.

### 2. Training Guidance (Engagement)

- **Workout Analysis**: Triggered automatically after a workout sync if "Auto-analyze Workouts" is enabled.
- **Daily Recommendation**: Sent on user-selected days and only during the user-selected local send-time window if "Auto-analyze Readiness" is enabled.

### 3. Subscription (Transactional)

- **Subscription Started**: Confirmation of upgrade.
- **Payment Failed**: Critical account notice when a billing invoice payment fails.
- **Payment Succeeded**: Renewal receipt when a recurring subscription payment succeeds.
- **Subscription Canceled**: Notice when a subscription is canceled or entitlement expires.

### 4. Marketing & Announcements (Marketing)

- **Marketing Broadcasts**: Sent via `POST /api/admin/email-deliveries/broadcast`. Enforces opt-in verification (`marketing: true`, `globalUnsubscribe: false`), suppression check, and includes standard HMAC unsubscribe footers. Uses `MarketingBroadcast` template.

## Compliance & Security

### Cryptographic Unsubscribe Tokens

Every email footer contains a unique, expiring, secure link:
`https://coachwatts.com/unsubscribe?token=BASE64URL_PAYLOAD.HMAC_SIGNATURE`

- **Generation**: `server/utils/unsubscribe-token.ts` signs a payload (`sub`, `purpose`, `iat`, `exp`, `nonce`) with `NUXT_AUTH_SECRET`.
- **Verification**: The `/unsubscribe` page verifies the signature to ensure only the account owner can use the link.
- **Suppression**: Unsubscribing via the token adds the user to the `EmailSuppression` table (manual reason) and updates their global preference.

## User Settings

Users can manage their experience in **Settings > Profile > Communication**:

- **Daily Training Recommendation**: Toggle days (Mon-Sun) and preferred time.
- **Workout Analysis**: Opt-in/out of individual session feedback.
- **Plan Updates**: Notification of coaching adjustments.
- **Global Unsubscribe**: Instantly opt-out of all optional communication.

## Developer CLI Commands

- `pnpm cw:cli email queue-welcome <userId>`: Test the welcome sequence.
- `pnpm cw:cli email queue-analysis <userId>`: Test workout analysis feedback.
- `pnpm cw:cli email queue-daily-coach <userId>`: Test daily recommendation briefs.
- `pnpm cw:cli email queue-subscription <userId>`: Test subscription confirmation.

## Tracking Conventions (UTM)

- `utm_source=coachwatts_email` for all email links.
- `utm_medium` by audience:
  - `transactional` for account and billing lifecycle mail.
  - `engagement` for coaching and analysis mail.
  - `lifecycle` for onboarding sequences.
- `utm_campaign` from the template registry, snake_case:
  - `welcome_onboarding`
  - `workout_received`
  - `workout_analysis_ready`
  - `daily_recommendation`
  - `subscription_started`
- `utm_content` for CTA-level attribution (for example `cta_connect_apps`, `cta_view_analysis`).

**Implementation Note**: Tracking is centralized in the `send-email` task orchestrator. Templates simply append the provided `utmQuery` prop to their links, ensuring all outbound communication follows these conventions without hardcoded strings.
